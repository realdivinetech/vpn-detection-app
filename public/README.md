## 🔧 How It Works

### Detection Process Flow

1. **Initialization**: System initializes all detection engines
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Multiple detection methods run simultaneously:
   - IP reputation check via multiple APIs
   - WebRTC leak test using STUN servers
   - Browser fingerprint generation and analysis
   - Location consistency verification
   - Bot/automation detection
   - Behavioral pattern analysis

3. **Risk Scoring**: Each method contributes to an overall confidence score, Based on the score, the system decides whether the user is likely using a VPN
4. **Result Compilation**: All results are aggregated into a comprehensive report

### WebRTC Leak Detection

The system performs WebRTC leak detection by creating RTCPeerConnection instances using a list of multiple STUN servers. These STUN servers include well-known public servers such as:

- stun.l.google.com:19302
- stun1.l.google.com:19302
- stun2.l.google.com:19302
- stun.services.mozilla.com
- stun.stunprotocol.org:3478
- stun.voipbuster.com
- stun.voipstunt.com
- stun.counterpath.com
- stun.ideasip.com
- stun.schlund.de

For each STUN server, the system gathers ICE candidates and extracts IP addresses from them. It categorizes these IPs into local IPv4, local IPv6, and public IPs. The detection also extracts the ICE candidate types such as "host", "srflx" (server reflexive), and "relay" (TURN server).

The presence of local IPs or public IPs in the ICE candidates indicates a WebRTC leak, which can reveal the user's real IP address even when using VPNs or proxies.

The detection engine uses this detailed WebRTC data to calculate a suspicion score. For example, the presence of "relay" candidates (TURN servers) may indicate VPN or proxy usage, increasing the suspicion score.

**Note on Server Reflexive Candidates ("srflx"):**  
These candidates represent the public IP address as seen by the STUN server and are crucial in detecting if the user's IP is being masked or relayed through a VPN or proxy.

This multi-server approach and detailed candidate analysis improve the reliability and accuracy of WebRTC leak detection.


### Location Mismatch Detection

This system detects location mismatches by comparing the user's GPS coordinates with the geolocation derived from their IP address. The system calculates the distance between these two locations and classifies the match level as follows:

- **Good**: Distance less than or equal to 300 km (likely same region or city)
- **Fair**: Distance between 301 km and 1000 km (possible ISP drift)
- **Mismatch**: Distance greater than 1000 km (GPS and IP locations are far apart)

A mismatch indicates potential VPN or proxy usage, helping identify users attempting to mask their true location and enhancing detection accuracy.


### IP Analysis

IP analysis is performed using a dedicated IP classifier module that evaluates the user's IP address against multiple criteria:

- Checks if the IP belongs to known hosting providers or datacenters by comparing against a curated list of IP ranges and ASN data.
- Detects if the IP is associated with known VPN or proxy providers by matching against known provider IP ranges.
- Queries the Tor Project's exit node list to identify Tor network usage.
- Calculates a risk level based on the presence of datacenter, hosting, proxy, or Tor indicators.
- Converts IP addresses to numeric form for efficient range checks.

This comprehensive IP analysis helps identify suspicious IP addresses commonly used by VPNs, proxies, or anonymization services.

### Detection Engine

The detection engine orchestrates multiple detection methods including IP analysis, WebRTC leak detection, browser fingerprinting, location mismatch detection, and bot detection. It runs these analyses in parallel and aggregates their results.

Key features include:

- Weighted scoring system that combines results from all detection methods to compute an overall confidence score.
- Detailed scoring for WebRTC candidate types such as relay and server reflexive candidates.
- Detection of fingerprint timezone and continent mismatches to identify spoofed browser environments.
- Bot detection using multiple heuristics to identify headless or automated browsers.
- Logging of detection results for further analysis.

This integrated approach improves the accuracy and reliability of VPN and proxy detection.

### Browser Fingerprinting

Browser fingerprinting collects various browser and device attributes such as user agent, screen resolution, installed fonts, and plugins to create a unique identifier. This technique helps detect suspicious or inconsistent fingerprints that may indicate anonymization tools or spoofing attempts, contributing to the overall risk assessment.

#### Fingerprint Spoofing Detection

The system detects when browser fingerprint data appears generic, inconsistent, or spoofed. For example, if the browser timezone is set to a generic value like "UTC" that does not match the IP-based timezone, or if other fingerprint attributes are suspicious, the system flags this as "Fingerprint Spoofed".

When fingerprint spoofing is detected:
- The label "Fingerprint Spoofed" is shown in the detection results.
- A small weight is added to the overall VPN suspicion score to reflect the increased risk.
- This helps identify users attempting to mask their real environment or location.

This feature improves the accuracy of VPN/proxy detection by considering anomalies in browser fingerprint data.

### IP Analysis Details

The system uses multiple IP analysis services for enhanced reliability:

- **Primary**: ip-api.com (comprehensive geolocation, ISP data, proxy and hosting detection)
- **Fallback 1**: ipify.org (public IP detection) combined with ipapi.co (geolocation and ISP data)
- **Fallback 2**: ipgeolocation.io (professional IP geolocation and risk scoring)
- **Additional**: ipinfo.io (optional, provides IP info and ASN data)

**Analyzed Data Points:**
- Public IP address and hostname
- Country, region, city, and coordinates
- ISP, organization, and ASN information
- Connection type (Mobile, Fiber, Cable, DSL)
- Datacenter and hosting provider detection
- Proxy, VPN, and Tor detection
- Risk assessment and threat intelligence



## Detection Calculation

The overall detection confidence score is calculated by combining weighted factors from:

- IP Analysis:
  - Datacenter IP (+40)
  - Hosting Provider IP (+35)
  - Tor Exit Node (+50)
  - VPN Server Detected via WhatIsMyIpAddress (+60)
  - Blacklisted IP via WhatIsMyIpAddress (+40)
  - Risk score from IP services (weighted by 0.5)
- WebRTC Leak (+10)
- Browser Fingerprint:
  - Timezone mismatch (+50)
  - Continent mismatch (+50)
  - Suspicion score (weighted by 0.5, +10 if suspicious)
- Location Mismatch (+50)
  - Includes distance mismatch (>300 km) and country mismatch between GPS and IP location.
- Bot/Automation Detection (+45)


## Fallback Logic

The system employs fallback mechanisms to improve reliability and accuracy:

- For IP detection, multiple IP analysis services are queried in parallel. If the public IP is not obtained from the primary services, the system falls back to fetching the IP from ipify.org.
- For IP geolocation and timezone, if the timezone is missing or unknown from the primary service, the system infers the timezone from the country code using a predefined mapping.
- In location mismatch detection, if the primary IP geolocation service (ip-api.com) fails, the system falls back to using ipapi.co for IP location data.

These fallback strategies ensure robust detection even if some services are unavailable or return incomplete data.
