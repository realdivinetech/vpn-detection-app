# VPN/Proxy Detection System

A comprehensive, open-source web-based system for detecting VPN, proxy, Tor, and other anonymization services using advanced multi-layer detection techniques.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Detection Methods
- **IP Analysis**: Comprehensive IP reputation, ASN classification, and hosting provider detection
- **WebRTC Leak Detection**: Identifies local IP leaks through STUN servers
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Analyzes browser characteristics and device properties to uniquely identify devices and detect anomalies
- **Location Verification**: Compares GPS coordinates with IP-based geolocation to detect inconsistencies indicating VPN or proxy use
- **Bot Detection**: Identifies automated browsers and headless environments
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitors user interaction patterns for suspicious activity

### Admin Dashboard
- **Secure Authentication**: Admin panel with configurable credentials
- **Detection Logs**: View historical detection results and statistics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track detection attempts and success rates
- **Data Export**: Export detection logs for analysis

### Technical Features
- **Multi-Service IP Analysis**: Uses 3 fallback IP analysis APIs for reliability
- **Real-time Results**: Live progress tracking during detection scans
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and modern development practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 19.0.1
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realdivinetech/vpn-detection-app.git
   cd vpn-detection-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

5. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   pnpm run preview
   ```

## üîß How It Works

### Detection Process Flow

1. **Initialization**: System initializes all detection engines
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Multiple detection methods run simultaneously:
   - IP reputation check via multiple APIs
   - WebRTC leak test using STUN servers
   - Browser fingerprint generation and analysis
   - Location consistency verification
   - Bot/automation detection
   - Behavioral pattern analysis

3. **Risk Scoring**: Each method contributes to an overall confidence score
4. **Result Compilation**: All results are aggregated into a comprehensive report

### Location Mismatch Detection

This system detects location mismatches by comparing the user's GPS coordinates with the geolocation derived from their IP address. Significant discrepancies between these two data points indicate potential VPN or proxy usage. This method helps identify users attempting to mask their true location, enhancing detection accuracy.

### Browser Fingerprinting

Browser fingerprinting collects various browser and device attributes such as user agent, screen resolution, installed fonts, and plugins to create a unique identifier. This technique helps detect suspicious or inconsistent fingerprints that may indicate anonymization tools or spoofing attempts, contributing to the overall risk assessment.

### IP Analysis Details

The system uses multiple IP analysis services for enhanced reliability:

- **Primary**: ip-api.com (comprehensive geolocation and ISP data)
- **Fallback 1**: ipify.org + ipapi.co (IP detection + geolocation)
- **Fallback 2**: ipgeolocation.io (professional IP analysis)

**Analyzed Data Points:**
- Public IP address and hostname
- Country, region, city, and coordinates
- ISP, organization, and ASN information
- Connection type (Mobile, Fiber, Cable, DSL)
- Datacenter and hosting provider detection
- Risk assessment and threat intelligence

### Detection Algorithms

### WhatIsMyIpAddress Scraping

The app fetches and parses the following pages for the user's IP:

- `https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/{ip}`: Extracts VPN server detection information.
- `https://whatismyipaddress.com/blacklist-check/`: Extracts blacklist status from multiple blacklist sources.

This data is incorporated into the IP analysis results.

## Detection Calculation

The overall detection confidence score is calculated by combining weighted factors from:

- IP Analysis:
  - Datacenter IP (+30)
  - Hosting Provider IP (+25)
  - Tor Exit Node (+40)
  - VPN Server Detected via WhatIsMyIpAddress (+50)
  - Blacklisted IP via WhatIsMyIpAddress (+30)
  - Risk score from IP services (weighted by 0.3)
- WebRTC Leak (+35)
- WebRTC Local IP Country Mismatch (+40)  
  - Compares the country of the WebRTC local IP (private IP) with the public IP country to improve VPN detection accuracy.
- Browser Fingerprint:
  - Timezone mismatch (+20)
  - Continent mismatch (+20)
  - Suspicion score (weighted by 0.4)
- Location Mismatch (+40)
  - Includes distance mismatch (>100 km) and country mismatch between GPS and IP location.
- Bot/Automation Detection (+35)

The confidence score is capped at 100. A VPN/proxy detection is flagged if the confidence score is 50 or higher, or if any critical flags (WebRTC leak, location mismatch, bot detection, fingerprint mismatch) are true.
**Confidence Levels:**
- 0-30%: Low risk (likely legitimate user)
- 31-50%: Medium risk (requires attention)
- 51-70%: High risk (likely using anonymization)
- 71-100%: Very high risk (confirmed VPN/proxy)

## Fallback Logic

If the IP timezone is missing or unknown, the app infers the timezone from the country code using a predefined mapping to improve timezone mismatch detection.

## üéØ Usage
